<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was created during an optional computer science course I took. We were learning Pygame and one of the final projects was to make a memory game. This was what I created!

Also, how else would I improve my memory skills? I play this game once a day and now I'm super smart.

### Built With

Python3.
Pygame.
